    "The regular expression is created using the RegExp constructor with the query string and the 'gi' flags. The 'g' flag makes the search global, meaning it will find all matches in the text. The 'i' flag makes the search case-insensitive, so it will match both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n",

    "ReDos Vulnerability Explanation\n",
    "The vulnerability arises from the use of the '.*' pattern in the regular expression. This pattern matches any character (except newline) zero or more times, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when combined with certain inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "'i'.repeat(54773) + '\\ngi' will cause catastrophic backtracking because the regex engine will try all possible combinations of the 'i' character before realizing that the 'gi' pattern cannot be matched. This can lead to a denial of service attack by consuming excessive CPU resources.\n"
